# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This is a project given to I and my partner by the Alx SE program. It entails different sorting algorthims and the Big O

What we are to learn from this project:

At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm


0. Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

1. Insertion sort
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

2. Selection sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

3. Quick sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

4. Shell sort - Knuth Sequence
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Shell sort algorithm, using the Knuth sequence

5. Cocktail shaker sort
Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Cocktail shaker sort algorithm
