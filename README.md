# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

This is a project given to I and my partner by the Alx SE program. It entails different sorting algorthims and the Big O

What we are to learn from this project:

At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm


0. Bubble sort
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
